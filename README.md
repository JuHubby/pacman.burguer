# Pac-Man Burger Bonanza: Chomp Down on Our Maze of Flavors!

Pac-Man Burger is Pac-Man's action of "chomping" or eating in the hamburguer.

## Usage:

This could be use in ethier as a feature in:

 - Menu Item: Feature the Pac-Man Burger as a special menu item in your restaurant or food establishment. Use the title as the name of the burger on your menu.

 - Promotional Material: Incorporate the title into your promotional materials such as posters, flyers, and banners to create excitement and attract customers to your Pac-Man-inspired food event.

 - Social Media: Share the title on your social media platforms to announce the special burger and encourage your followers to come and try it. You can also use relevant Pac-Man images or graphics in your posts.

## Roadmap:

I am planning to improve this so much. This is just the first step. There are so many improvements to add. For example: I want to make the hamburger go down in a zigzag through the page, and the Pac-Man reaching it at some point toward the end of the page. Once Pac-Man reaches it, the hamburger should disappear, and Pac-Man should increase an inch in size. I also want to add an effect of an explosion of flavors as soon as Pac-Man eats the hamburger.

Afterward, I would like to create a loop where the hamburger regenerates as a 0.1 better-flavored hamburger and starts moving upward in a zigzag throughout the page. Simultaneously, Pac-Man should reverse and do the same zigzag pattern, but this time moving upwards.
